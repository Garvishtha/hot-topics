    <p> Before money was used as a medium of exchange, people used to exchange goods and services in order to pay a value. It was something similar to what can be called an agreement to trade.
    
     It was very difficult to obtain divisibility in such a setup. For instance if there is a person who needs bread and has apples, they will have to find someone who not only has apples, but also needs bread. 
     
      Even after they find each other, it is very difficult for them to measure the value of each product without having a common ground for measurement.
      
     Then came the commodity money in the late 17th and early 18th century which was a set of goods that acted as money. Gold was also a commodity money.
     
     Currently most of us are dealing with the M1 category of money which is also known as active money.

        Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) is when people alter the genomes of animals and plants for a lot of years using traditional breeding techniques for various possible reasons. This is also called genetic engineering. 
        
        There are various uses of genetic engineering such as, it increses crop yields, reduces the cost for drug and food froduction, it also reduces the need for pesticides  as it creates some type of resistance to diseases and pests.
             
        As bacteria is the easiest organisms to engineer they can be used for research, industrial protien purification and food production. 
                    
        A vast majyority of animals are still at research phase as they are comparitavely harder to transform.      </p>
